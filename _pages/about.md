I design and develop modern, scalable web applications using Python, Java, FastAPI, and Spring Boot.
My experience spans both relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases, delivering robust and efficient solutions.

On the frontend, I build intuitive and optimized interfaces using React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Experienced in integrating REST and GraphQL APIs, including Shopify API for e-commerce solutions.

I also develop custom interfaces in Webflow through embedded and before-body custom code.
Skilled in automated testing (Pytest, JUnit), containerization with Docker, and version control with Git/GitHub.

I apply SOLID principles, design patterns, and best practices to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
I quickly adapt to new environments and enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to build innovative solutions.
